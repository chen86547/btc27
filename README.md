It is characterized by using P2P peer-to-peer network technology to issue, manage and circulate currency, theoretically avoiding bureaucratic approval, thereby giving everyone the right to issue currency. Digital currency payment is the use of the above types of digital currencies for transactions.

Users can check the funds on the Tether platform to ensure transparency. Users can exchange USD via wire transfer from SWIFT to a bank account provided by Tether or exchange USD for USD. Users can also exchange Bitcoin for USDT on the trading platform.

Each financial institution Each has its own settlement process, and the entire payment process is particularly complex, which directly leads to high time and economic costs in the transaction process. This situation is no longer suitable for the development level of today's globalized economy.
